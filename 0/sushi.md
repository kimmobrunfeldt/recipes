# Sushi set (Draft version)

This recipe cooks a sushi meal for ~4-5 persons. It takes ~1-2 hours and you are
ready to eat.

Having these supplies help:

* a big enough pot for sushi rice cooking with a lid, preferably teflon coated

  Or a rice cooker.

* sharp knife
* sushi rolling bamboo mat


## Ingredients

### Rice

* 625ml cold water
* 500g sushi rice
* 100g plain rice vinegar (no sugar included)
* 110g white sugar
* 2 teaspoons of salt (10ml)


### Sushi rolls / nigiri fillings

* 300-400g D-cut salmon (fishbones removed).

    Try to find a solid trunk piece. Tail part works for sushi rolls but isn't
    good when you are making nigiris.

* 10 - 20 nori sheets (seaweed)
* soy sauce for dipping. I prefer [Kikkoman Sweet Soy Sauce](http://www.kikkoman.com.au/sites/default/files/styles/product_default/public/product_image/sweet-soy-sauce-250ml.png?itok=8tSA-7LU)

* mayonnaise
* cucumber
* carrot

**Optional**

* sesam seeds
* scallion


### Tuna filling for sushi rolls

* 150g canned tuna chunks in water
* 60ml (4 tbsp) mayonnaise
* 30ml (2 tbsp) sweet chili sauce
* 10ml (2 tsp) soy sayce

**Optional**

* lime wedge, for juice
* sunflower oil


## Preparing rice

Rinse sushi rice at least 5 times or until the water runs clean. [Why?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IU_yH8SMsc). [Example of rinsing.](https://youtu.be/IqCAVS4_obw?t=367)
Let the rice dry while preparing rice vinegar mix.

Mix rice vinegar + sugar + salt well. You can heat lightly while mixing
to make sugar and salt dissolve.

*I assume you don't have a steam boiler.* Put cold water and rice into a pot.
Apply full heat until the water starts slowly boiling. Reduce the
heat so the water keeps boiling slowly, place a lid on the pot and start
a 13-minute timer. No peeking under the lid! Water shouldn't boil over.
After 13 minutes, move the pan away from the heat and let it sit there for 10
minutes with the lid still on.

Now you're free to open the lid. You should have cooked rice and all water
evaporated. Place the rice on a flat container. Try not to squeeze the rice
too much. Pour the rice vinegar mix on the rice evenly.
Let the rice cool off. It should be at body temperature, and shouldn't feel too warm in your hands.
If you are in a hurry, it can still be a bit warm - don't worry.

## Preparing sushi roll fillings

* Peel the carrot and cut it to sticks. Boil the carrots a bit to soften them
* Cut cucumber to sticks and optionally remove most of the watery center.

### Cut salmon

How to cut salmon: https://youtu.be/bFoIJCDEqGw?t=80. This was the closest
video I found, but you shouldn't leave any brown flesh to salmon when using
it for nigiris.

### Prepare tuna mix

Just mix all ingredients together well.
