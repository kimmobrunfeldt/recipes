## Rice

**Ingredients**

* 625ml cold water
* 500g sushi rice
* 100g plain rice vinegar (no sugar included)
* 110g white sugar
* 2 teaspoons of salt (10ml)
* a big enough pot with a lid, preferably teflon coated

Rinse sushi rice at least 5 times or until the water runs clean. [Why?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IU_yH8SMsc). [Example of rinsing.](https://youtu.be/IqCAVS4_obw?t=367)
Let the rice dry while preparing rice vinegar mix.

Mix rice vinegar + sugar + salt well. You can heat lightly while mixing to make sugar and salt dissolve.

*I assume you don't have a steam boiler.* Put cold water and rice into a pot.
Apply full heat until the water starts slowly boiling. Reduce the heat so the water
keeps boiling slowly, place
a lid on the pot and start a 13-minute timer. No peeking under the lid! Water shouldn't boil over. After 13
minutes, move the pan away from the heat and let it sit there for 10 minutes with the lid still on.

Now you're free to open the lid. You should have cooked rice and all water evaporated.
Place the rice on a flat container. Try not to squeeze the rice too much. Pour the rice vinegar
mix on the rice evenly. Let the rice cool off. It should be at body temperature, and shouldn't
feel too warm in your hands. If you are in a hurry, it can still be a bit warm - don't worry.
